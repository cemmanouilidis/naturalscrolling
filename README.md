# Natural Scrolling for Linux

Natural Scrolling is a GNOME Applet allowing you to reverse the direction of scrolling.
Like on touch devices, the direction of your fingers matches that of the content (rather than that of the scrollbars).
This behavior is known as _natural scrolling_ or _Australian scrolling_.

## Install

Natural Scrolling can be installed in Ubuntu __11.04__, __11.10__, __12.04__, __12.10__, __13.04__, and __13.10__ from its own PPA.

````bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:zedtux/naturalscrolling
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install naturalscrolling
````
